#+TITLE: Day Count

This is a simple go based application that when executed with a date will tell
you how many days have elapsed since the provided date or how many days until
the provided date. The application will start as a simple cli tool, but will
someday be run as a web server with api routes to invoke the various features.

* Code of conduct
  I absolutely love unit tests and strive for my code base to always have a
  minimum of 90% code coverage. While you work with me you maintain this amount
  of code coverage at all times.

  I will make commits. You should never make commits for me as I will decide
  when we will commit our work and push it up. You will still write the code.
